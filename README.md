# Youtrack Custom Widget

## Description

I realised, during research I made to develop my own widgets, that most of the information and boilerplate provided by Jetbrains is outdated.
So I created this repository in order to help people get started with a more up to date project using Vite, React with functional components and Ring-UI.

This repository can be used as a template so you don't need to fork it.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run: ```bun install```

## Development

Use the Widget Playground in Youtrack while developing in order to access the APIs in real time.

1. Run ```bun dev``` to start the development server.
2. Go to the Widget Playground, in the Custom Widgets section, on Youtrack.
3. Insert the URL of the development server in the widget URL field.

## Build

1. Run ```bun package``` to package the widget.

## Deployment

1. Go to the Custom Widgets section in Youtrack.
2. Press "New Widget" and upload the packaged widget (zip folder).
